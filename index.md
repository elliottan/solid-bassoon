## Welcome!
Hi! I'm Elliot Tan, a passionate and fun-loving guy, and I will be using this space mainly to share some applications that I have previously worked on. However, you may find some other non-tech related stuff along the way. Hope you enjoy the page :)

## Homebakes [(Mobile-Optimised PWA)](https://bake-shop-sg.herokuapp.com/)<a name="homebakes"></a>
Sep 2020 | Singapore

Have a friend who started baking during the Covid-19 lockdown period and can't seem to stop posting about it on Instagram? Or perhaps you have five of those friends. Direct them to [Homebakes](https://bake-shop-sg.herokuapp.com/) today to list and sell their surplus bread and cakes!

In a team of four, we developed and deployed the Homebakes PWA in a span of two weeks. I worked mostly on the frontend, using ReactJS and Material-UI. Unexpectedly, I have taken a liking towards frontend development, and this is something I would never have thought I'd say. It was really quite fun learning to build a real PWA, and seeing it download to my mobile home screen and even on my computer was quite satisfying.

## Modmates [(Figma Hi-Fi Prototype)](https://www.figma.com/proto/rHaPiJvcyKacnH4EqkbpCT/Modmates-Final?node-id=6%3A0&scaling=scale-down)<a name="modmates"></a>
Aug 2020 | Singapore

We all know the feeling of taking a module and not knowing anyone in class. Modmates is an application to help students find friends in modules they are taking, to meet new people, form study groups, or just complain about their homework together.

Through a iterative process of design and validation, I was part of a team of four that grew a prototype for an application from wifeframes to extremely hi-fi, taking into account feedback from  a multitude user interviews. The final Figma prototype can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/rHaPiJvcyKacnH4EqkbpCT/Modmates-Final?node-id=6%3A0&scaling=scale-down), and here are some screens from a prototype I am really proud of.

## Full Stack Developer @ [Lumitics](https://lumitics.com/)<a name="lumitics"></a>
Apr 2020 - Present | Singapore

Currently, I am interning at Lumitics, a startup that provides food waste tracking solutions to restaurants, canteens, and airlines. With a team of 7 other interns, I have contributed to help build a mobile data visualisation platform for clients to gain insights and get data of their food waste.

This was done with React and NodeJS, and I have touched many parts of the tech stack, such as frontend, backend, database, testing and dev-ops. Really grateful for this experience, and it was quite a blessing to have worked with such a solid and nice team!

## iOS Developer @ [Lomotif](https://lomotif.com/)<a name="lomotif"></a>
May 2019 – Aug 2019 | Singapore

I interned at Lomotif, a social media mobile application developed by a small Singapore startup that got really popular in the West. Here, I picked up the Swift programming language, and how to develop mobile applications in Xcode.

My main tasks were conceptualizing and prototyping new features. One of them was the in-app notification system and video upload manager features, which actually made it into the live application. I had to work hard to test and integrate them, improving the Lomotif user experience for millions of users worldwide:

_1) Upload progress icon, 2) Upload progress indicators, 3) In-app notifications_

I also prototyped a revamp to the clip picker gallery, to give it a more modern look and feel:

_1) Original gallery, 2) New gallery, 3) New gallery scrolled down_

The clip picker gallery improvements also included a bar where clips selected can be seen at a glance, as well as rearranged:

_1) Original clip picker, 2) New clip picker, featuring a preview bar with clips that can be dragged and dropped_

## QR Code Registration System @ [College of Alice and Peter Tan](https://capt.nus.edu.sg/)<a name="capt"></a>
During my student life in the National University of Singapore, I stayed at the College of Alice and Peter Tan. There were many opportunities to learn and grow, and one particular program I was part of is the College of Alice and Peter Tan Student Symposium (CAPTISS).

As part of the logistics-tech team, I build a webpage that uses scanned QR codes to record student attendance for events in the student hostel, not only for the aforementioned CAPTISS, but also for formal dinners, and Master's Tea sessions. It was developed to replace a manual paper registration system, so that registration queues move much faster.

I implemented the webpage with Java Server Pages and Apache Tomcat, while another student I was working with, Nicholas, implemented the UI design. You may find screenshots and the repository [here](https://github.com/elliottan/CAPTISS-QR-Registration).

## Web Developer @ IBM Ireland Product Distribution<a name="ibm"></a>
Apr 2014 – Aug 2014 | Singapore

This was my first internship, and my first taste of what working a real software development job is like! During my stint at IBM, I picked up Java Servlets and Java Server Pages to  enhance an existing manufacturing tracker dashboard.

The main feature I implemented was a risk analysis tool, so that users are warned about potential lack of parts one week in advance and can act to resolve it. The colourful table cells in the screenshot below was what I improved upon. Each colour represents a different phase of the manufacturing process, and the cells represent the prediction of which phase of manufacturing the product will be in on a particular day. This had to account for non-working days, shortage of parts, as well as other criteria:

_Some information has been blurred out for the sake of privacy_

Also, I proposed and actualized a graphical and interactive presentation of data tables, as I found it to be a more intuitive and powerful visualization tool for the user:

## The Devils Sea @ [Ngee Ann Polytechnic](https://www.np.edu.sg)<a name="devilsea"></a>
I've always liked game programming, as I find games really interesting and cool. When I was studying a Diploma in Information Technology at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, I had the opportunity to create a game as part of a project. I worked on this with my friend Jeremy, using Game Maker Studio, and I am extremely proud of the end result. Check it out [here](https://github.com/elliottan/The-Devils-Sea-Game)!
